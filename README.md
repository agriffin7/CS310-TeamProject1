  Purpose of this program:
     This is a program created with multiple users by using the Scrum Method. This program was in development for over a month in a half. The purpose of this program is to be used with time and attendance based systems, such as used in manufacturing or warehouse companies. This program is used to help keep track of the shifts, the employee's arrival times, their departure times, and also do overall attendance while managing things such as employees hours and adding or deducting hours to the correct time
                                                          
   This Program is written in java, but interacts with an SQL Query by using the JDBC API. this allows the program to access the database that contains the employee information, the shift information, and other useful things. This program can also pull, push, and modify data within the database. This program does not require any outside assistance with accessing the database information, as it has all be embedded within the main file.
   
   This github contains all parts of this program, even the test files to ensure certain features where working correctly. This program can be implemented into use with a time-clock system. The main file of this program handles most of the operations, while the other files such as Punch and Badge are for object information. This program uses Object Orientated Programming to accomplish it's goals.
